# crypto_newsletter
The code in this repository has been used to create a <b>personal mailer</b> that informed me about the state of my crypto asets.
After finished the development, the code has been scheduled to run periodically in an <b>Amazone EC2</b> instance using <b>crontab</b>.
For the sake of keeping my privacy, I have removed all the credentials from the config file.
